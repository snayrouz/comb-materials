//A publisher emits two kinds of events:
//1. Values, also referred to as elements.
//2. A completion event.
//A publisher can emit zero or more values but only one completion event, which can either be a normal completion event or an error. Once a publisher emits a completion event, itâ€™s finished and can no longer emit any more events.
